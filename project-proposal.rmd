Project Description
The survey data aims to measure attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace, and examine the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers.

The Open Sourcing Mental Illness team of volunteers use this data to drive work in raising awareness and improving conditions for those with mental health disorders in the IT workplace.
